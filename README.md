**CPU Scheduling**

CPU Scheduling is a critical aspect of operating system design, responsible for efficiently allocating CPU resources to various processes. This project presents a meticulously crafted class implementation tailored for priority-based CPU scheduling tasks.

Implemented in C++, the system orchestrates the execution of processes based on their priority levels, ensuring that higher priority tasks are given precedence over lower priority ones. This helps optimize system performance and responsiveness, particularly in scenarios where multiple processes compete for CPU time.

The project encapsulates essential functionalities such as process prioritization, scheduling algorithm execution, and resource allocation. Through this implementation, users gain insights into the intricacies of CPU scheduling mechanisms and their impact on system behavior.
