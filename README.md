# CPU Scheduling

## Overview

The **CPU Scheduling** project is designed to demonstrate the principles of process scheduling in operating systems. This implementation focuses on priority-based CPU scheduling.
This is a simplified implementation for the Operating Systems course. 

## Project Description

In this project, a C++ program has been developed to simulate CPU scheduling based on process priority levels. The primary goal is to manage the execution of processes by prioritizing them according to their assigned priority values, ensuring that higher priority tasks are processed before lower priority ones.

## Features

- **Priority-Based Scheduling:**
  - Implements a priority-based scheduling algorithm to manage the execution order of processes.

- **Process Management:**
  - Handles the creation and management of processes with different priority levels.

- **Resource Allocation:**
  - Manages CPU time allocation among processes based on their priority, illustrating how CPU resources are distributed.
